        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <p><b>Q: What program(s) do you use to make pixel art?</b></p>
        <p>
            A: I use <a href="https://aseprite.org">aseprite</a>! (it's $20, but definitely worth it.)
            <br>
            For non-pixel art, I typically use krita (...or just my physical sketchbook)
        </p>

        <p><b>Q: Where does the name 'fds_t' come from?</b></p>
        <p>A: The 'fds' comes from one time when I was playing tetris in highscool and mashed the keyboard when the name entry screen appeared. It's also coincidentally the initials for the Famicom Disk System, which I thought was funny (is why I kept using it.)
        <br>
        As for the '_t' part, it's a reference to th...actually, here's some lore about it, FUCK YOU 'fds_t' on twitter for literally NEVER posting ANYTHING and just keeping the @ hostage, making me have to take 'fds_ty' instead!!</p>

        <!--
        <p><b>Q: Are your commisions open / what are your prices?</b></p>
        <p>A: I have never opened commisions.</p>

        <p><b>(and the follow-up) Q: Will you?</b></p>
        <p>A: I have no idea. If you do actually want one you can probably just ask me and I might consider it maybe? My bsky/tumblr dms are open, you know...</p>
        -->

        <p><b>Q: Who's your favorite touhou character?</b></p>
        <p>A: My answer has "always been" Doremy.... but... recently, I'd probably say it's a toss-up between her and Yukari.....</p>

        <p><b>Q: Your [rendered pixel art] style reminds me of a certain nsfw artist's.</b></p>
        <p>A: This isn't a question, but the fact that this has literally only been brought up on reddit (and still continues to be brought up, again, ONLY on reddit,) is very funny to me. I guess the website truly does live up to it's reputation.</p>

        <p><b>Q: Were these questions actually asked before?</b></p>
        <p>A: All of the above questions have been asked <i>at least</i> two times.<br>...that excludes this one :P</p>
