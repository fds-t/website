                This is my OC fox girl, who is also literally the only OC I have. And also doesn't have a name. Originally made as a joke cause a bunch of people on my twitter tl were making OCs at around the same time, and again repurposed for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vswnri7goqzhoe3cj5zss2ea/post/3llqmy2rqy22x">an april fools joke</a> (yes, it actually isn't Momiji.)
                <br>
                She doesn't really have any "lore" or anything like that (well, except <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vswnri7goqzhoe3cj5zss2ea/post/3llruobm5mc2l">this</a> I guess), she's mostly just a character that I draw for fun, and that's about it.
